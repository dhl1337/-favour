# favour
Favour is a web application that allows people to post favors or offer services on a thread. Each individual has their own profile, which allows others to rate and review their experiences. If there is a post that you are interested in click on the star and it will save the post into your “favorite” tab. Everyone can use a hand every once in awhile, therefore with the Favour website it makes interacting with the local community convenient.
